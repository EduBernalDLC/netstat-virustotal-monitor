netstat-virustotal-monitor
==========================

netstat is a de-facto standard command for monitoring incoming and outgoing network connections on Linux/Windows platforms. A python-based script enhances this netstat command output to include city, country and ASN information using Maxmind Geolite databases. In addition, it also checks whether the remote IP is in malicious or not using Virustotal database.
